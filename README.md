## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project basically helped me to reinforce my knowledge of `CSS grid` when it comes to deal with asymetric grids and make them `responsive`;
Another good learning point is that `prefixes` or `Vendors` are great use cases when it comes to make that browsers could handle non standard or experimental CSS properties.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [caniuse](https://caniuse.com) helped me to verify which `CSS property` is supported by which navigator or not, and occasionally fix it with a recommendation of which approach will fit in any situation.
- [type-scale](https://type-scale.com/) - This is an amazing website in term of implementing a great hierarchy and be consistent in design choices.
